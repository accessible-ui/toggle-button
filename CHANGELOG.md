## 2.0.0 (2020-07-09)

### âš  BREAKING CHANGES

- ToggleButton is no longer a default export. It is a named export e.g. `import {ToggleButton} from '@accessible/toggle-button'`. Additionally, there is no more context as I've
  deemed it unnecessary with the addition of the hook.

### Features

- add useA11yToggleButton hook ([62356b0](https://github.com/accessible-ui/toggle-button/commit/62356b0fa3c8c4559e9e065cfdbb5dc5178d6c40))
